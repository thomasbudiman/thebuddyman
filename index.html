            <h2>3 Things To Consider When You Stick To Your Resolutions</h2>
              
            <br/>
            <p>
            The beginning of a new year has always been a good time for writing resolutions. Perhaps you’d like to make time for exercise or maybe you want to learn a new language. Well, it’s personal! You can cook up anything you want. If you have already written your resolutions, I hope this post can help you to keep up with it.</p> <br/><hr style="width:20%;"><br/>

                <h3>#1 If you want to start a new behavior
<br/> <h4>You need to start small, even tiny</h4>
</h3>
<p>
Do you want to start exercising your body? reading books? writing?
You need to start it with the easiest version, don’t be too ambitious. Based on Dr. BJ Fogg , to do a new behavior you have to start it small(even tiny), e.g. if you want to start reading, you can start for one minute a day. This may look ridiculous. We will only get a small gain and progress from a small effort. But what we want to shoot is, we want to get the behavior more automatic. That’s why we need it easy as possible, so that we are able to do consistently, even when we feel lazy or don’t have much energy to do it. In fact, by reading one minute a day then make small increments each day, you could have finished a 300–400 page book in a month.</p><br/><hr style="width:20%;"><br/>
<p>
    
   <h3> #2 If you want to learn a new skill </h3>
                <h4>You need to find how you learn best</h4>
<p>Learning a new skill is not easy, especially you plan to learn by yourself. Whether it’s improving your skill sets or totally a new. Yeah, we need to realize that we no longer study in a formal school which obligates us to attend the lessons. We need to deal with ourselves. The best practice is, find how you learn best by trying and failing. Enjoy the process and don’t force ourselves to learn many things in a short time. Actually, we can use tips #1 (take tiny steps). Be consistent. As James Clear said in his post “Whenever you put in consistent work and learn from your mistakes, incredible progress is the result”.</p<br/><br/>

<br/><hr style="width:20%;"><br/>

                <h3>#3 If you want to break a bad habit</h3>
                <h4>You need to replace with a good one</h4>
                <p>

Basically, how to break a bad habit is by replacing them with other habit.
As described by Charles Duhigg in his book, The Power of Habit. every habit has a same pattern, with the 3 steps : the cue (a trigger to start a routine), the routine (the activity or habit) and the reward (the benefits of doing routine), e.g. When you get stressed, you want to smoke. Then, you feel more relaxed. Duhigg said the key is “If we keep the same cue and the same reward, a new routine can be inserted”. But, that’s not enough to break a bad habit. According to him, we must believe change is possible. Most likely, belief will grow out with the support of other people. Find accountability buddies who can help and motivate you.<br/></p>

            <h2>How To Learn Something New By Yourself</h2>
              
            <br/>
            <p>
            We definitely want to be better every year. Continuous learning can make ourselves better. Yes, we are never too old to learn something new, whether it’s enhancing your skill set or something completely new. To learn something new is not easy, therefore strong dedication and self determination is required.</p> <br/><hr style="width:20%;"><br/>
<p>
First of all, you need to <strong>figure out what you are actually interested in</strong>. It could be tons of things : language, coding, writing, drawing, cooking or even dancing.
You can pick something to support your career or something for fun.</p><br/><hr style="width:20%;"><br/>
<p>
<strong>Where to learn?</strong> For certain skills like dancing or singing, you still need to find an onsite formal-course, or perhaps a good teacher for serious learning. But, for some skills that doesn’t need to be onsite. You can try finding out information from the internet. The internet provides you with two options :<br/><br/>

<ol class="numbering">
<li>If you like to go with the wind. You can google or find sources from <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/" target="_blank">pinterest</a>, <a href="https://www.bloglovin.com/" target="_blank">bloglovin</a> or <a href="http://tutsplus.com/" target="_blank">tuts+</a> . Try to follow blogs of expert as well.</li><br/><br/>

<li>If you’re into structured learning, you can try online course such as :  
<a href="https://www.udemy.com/" target="_blank">Udemy</a>, <a href="http://www.skillshare.com/" target="_blank">Skillshare</a>, <a href="https://www.codeschool.com/" target="_blank">Codeschool</a>, <a href="http://teamtreehouse.com/" target="_blank">Teamtreehouse</a>, <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/" target="_blank">Khan Academy</a></li>
</ol>    
    
    
</p><br/><hr style="width:20%;"><br/>
<p>

Next is, <strong>finding how you learn best</strong>. We need to understand that we no longer study in school which obligates us to attend the lesson. In other words, we are independent learners. We are free to personalize the process, methods and schedule. Make yourself enjoy and happy. Though it’s not easy, the best way to find out is by trying and failing.<br/><br/></p>

<div class="quoteblock">For independent learners, it’s essential to find the process and methods that match your instinctual tendencies as a learner.
One of the keys to success and enjoyment as an independent learner is to discover how you learn. - <a href="http://www.kiostark.com/dont-go-back-to-school/" target="_blank">Kio Stark — Don’t Go Back To School</a> </div>
<br/><br/>
<p>    
Maintaining consistency would be the key for best result too. We don’t need to learn many things in a short time. Put our effort in reps. As James Clear said in his <a href="http://jamesclear.com/repetitions" target="_blank">post</a><br/><br/></p>

<div class="quoteblock">                
Embrace the long, slow walk to greatness and focus on putting in your reps.
Whenever you put in consistent work and learn from your mistakes, incredible progress is the result.
